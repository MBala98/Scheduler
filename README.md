# Scheduler
Program to imitate work of processor, working on different threads.

There are many types of strategies:
FCFS - First Come, First Served
SJF - Shortest Job First
SRT - Shortest Remaining Time
PS -  Processor Sharing
RR -  Round Robin

Program analizes which strategy is the most optimal. It takes data from stdin or file given as parameter to program.
Data should have following format:
<number of threads>
<moment of showing in queue> <demand> - this line should be given <number of threads> times
<number of strategies of RR>
<values of strategy RR> - <number of strategies of RR> times.
